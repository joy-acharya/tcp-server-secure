# TCP Encrypted Messaging Server

A lightweight, production-ready TCP server designed for encrypted communication with clients over persistent connections. Built using Node.js and Redis, this server supports chunked message delivery, ACK handling, AES-GCM encryption, and a scalable event loop with heartbeat detection.

## Features

- üîê AES-256-GCM based encryption
- üîÅ Persistent bi-directional TCP communication
- üß© Supports chunked/streamed packets with null-byte delimiter
- üîÇ Retry logic with acknowledgments for event delivery
- üßµ Handles multiple client connections concurrently
- üíì Heartbeat detection with ping/pong to track live clients
- üíæ Redis-backed queueing for event and usage tracking
- üîÑ Handles reconnects, client state cleanup
- üß™ Ready for unit/integration testing
- üß∞ Modular and extensible design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Redis >= 6 (with optional password protection)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joy-acharya/tcp-encrypted-server.git
cd tcp-encrypted-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration

Edit the `.env` file with your Redis settings:

```ini
PORT=9000
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

### Running the Server

```bash
node src/socket-server.js
```

### Testing with Client

Use the provided client simulator to test chunked handshake, reconnections, and heartbeat:

```bash
node client/multi-client-simulator.js
```

## API Overview

### Client Message Types

- `handshake` ‚Äî Initial connection: `{ type: "handshake", clientId: "101" }`
- `ack` ‚Äî Acknowledges a server event: `{ type: "ack", eventId: "evt123" }`
- `client-event` ‚Äî Sends data from client to server: `{ type: "client-event", ... }`
- `pong` ‚Äî Heartbeat response to server's `ping`

### Server Message Types

- `server-event` ‚Äî Pushes an event to the client
- `ping` ‚Äî Periodic heartbeat check to ensure client is alive

## Security

- AES-256-GCM encryption for all payloads
- Each packet includes IV + AuthTag for decryption
- Key derived using Diffie-Hellman + HKDF (planned extension)
